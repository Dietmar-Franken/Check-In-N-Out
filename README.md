# Check-In-N-Out
Two-Way Appointment Management System to be used in conjunction with the Android App for HackGSU's Visitor Challenge (https://devpost.com/software/check-in-n-out)

Android App: https://github.com/lealex262/Check-In-N-Out-App

## Inspiration
We wanted a way to have a mostly hands-free, minimum-effort check-in process that allowed for ease of convenience for people making appointments to businesses and the like. Furthermore, we wanted to reduce the time it took for security personnel to check in and check out visitors while simultaneously notifying workers for whom the appointments are directed towards.

## What it does
The web application was created with the purpose of registering visitors who were able to make appointments while workers were able to approve appointments. The android app was designed for an easier and faster check-in process on-site. It also allowed for an easier way for security to keep track of visitors and their information.
